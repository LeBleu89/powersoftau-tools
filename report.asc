I burned 3 DVD-R with all needed software :
1) Fedora 27 Live DVD
2) compute binary (build by myself) and brasero software
3) challenge file


Sidechannel Defences
====================

I tried to make a rudimentary faraday cage with aluminum foil all around the airgap compute node. The compute node was plug only to the screen, keyboard, mouse and DVD reader.
The compute node is a spare Dell precision T3610 already used before. I removed hard drive and speaker. There was no wifi or bluetooth chip inside.
All the computing process was done on RAM and i run 1 pass of Memtest before and 2 passes after.
I was alone in my flat(except my cat) during the compute process with no device around the compute node.

Procedure
=========
I downloaded Fedora iso and challenge file on my daily computer and i burned then into DVD-R media.

I booted the airgap compute node, on Fedora Live DVD and I created a ramfs partition to store compute binary and challenge file.
I enter some text to provide additional entropy as requested :
- - License plate of random cars in the street
- - Words taken randomly in one book on my desk
- - Random type on keyboard

Computing process took around 1 hour.

I burned a 4th DVD-R with response file and I inserted it inside my daily computer to upload it.

The BLAKE2b hash of `./response` is:
    b39c2f54 485df51c d0434b0d 3cbfcff7
    b7cc02c2 e9410975 26cf5e60 5c9f8aad
    dd3cf937 2d0e567c ad8c49d7 b507a47d
    ac751020 3a7f2f00 b7d78106 36064f06

Postprocessing
==============
I destroyed the 4 DVD and i run a complete Memtest on compute node, 2 passes.

I did not destroy the computer or hardware inside but i won't used it until 1 month and it will be unplugged from power source.
